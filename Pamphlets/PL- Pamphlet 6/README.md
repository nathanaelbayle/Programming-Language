# Calculator language structure

## Interpreter for calculator with variables and external primitive functions
Pamphlet 6 has detailed instructions on how to upgrade the interpreter with variables to use
an external set of primitive functions.

## Extended set of primitive functions
Here we follow the instructions given in pamphlet 6. Haskell already supports
the primitives ``gcd`` and ``lcm`` , see https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/haskellch6.html.

## Unit test
Note how the unit test and main function have not been modified.
